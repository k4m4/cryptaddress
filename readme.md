# Installation & Configuration

Clone the repository and install all dependencies by running:

```
~ ❯❯❯ git clone https://github.com/k4m4/cryptaddress.now
~ ❯❯❯ cd cryptaddress.now/
~/cryptaddress.now ❯❯❯ npm install
```

Subsequently, create a `.env` file and declare a variable called `SECRET` (for session security purposes):

```
~/cryptaddress.now ❯❯❯ echo "SECRET=[your-secret-goes-here]" > .env
~/cryptaddress.now ❯❯❯ npm start
```

You can then access the service by navigating to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/).
